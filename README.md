# Password Manager

## Overview

Password Manager is a simple python program that allows users to store and manage their passwords.
It uses `Cryptography` package to encrypt passwords and keep them secure. When the program is launched
for the first time, the user will have to enter a master password that they would have to remember and
use for subsequent logins.
